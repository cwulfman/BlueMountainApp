                    <li>Blue Mountain will concentrate on, but not be limited
	  to, the scarce and ephemeral texts of the period between
	  1848 and 1923: journals, magazines, manifestos, and other
	  publications which, taken together, underlay the emergence
	  of modernity in Europe and the Americas.</li>
                    <li>Blue Mountain will focus on no single nation, but will
	  strive to encompass publications in all languages. By
	  creating machine-readable transcriptions of these texts, we
	  will expose them to increasingly sophisticated
	  machine-assisted translation tools that open them to
	  students and scholars from many countries and
	  disciplines.</li>
                    <li>Blue Mountain believes society benefits from open
	  engagement with its past and is therefore committed to
	  making cultural-heritage materials freely available to
	  all.</li>
                    <li>Because the publication history of many of these texts
	  is obscure, and because the location, condition, and
	  completeness of remaining holdings are imperfectly known,
	  Blue Mountain will support, foster, and promulgate
	  bibliographic histories and make them available in
	  discursive and encoded forms.</li>
                    <li>Blue Mountain will be an active participant in the
	  evolving relationship among scholarship, curation, and
	  technology. In adhering to standards and best practices of
	  scholars, librarians, and information scientists, Blue
	  Mountain will maintain a cyberinfrastructure that ensures
	  long-term preservation and access independent of
	  content-delivery software and supports data exchange among
	  projects and disciplines.</li>
