                    <p>In August 2014, Blue Mountain completed its inaugural NEH grant cycle. In that two-year
                        period, we digitized and made accessible 2,441 magazine issues, comprising 56,466 pages
                        and 60,073 articles. </p>

                    </header>
                    <p>This academic year – as we wait to hear back about a next NEH grant - we are
                        adding several new titles to the Blue Mountain collection: <i>Pan</i>,
                            <i>Ver Sacrum</i>, <i>Apollon</i>, and <i>Vestik Rabotnikov
                        Iskusstv</i>. At the same time, we’ve been working on a parallel initiative,
                        the German Modernism Project, which focuses on German language magazines
                        from Princeton’s Blau Memorial Collection. Five titles from that collection
                        - <i>Die Schöne Raitatät</i>, <i>Genius</i>, <i>Der Gegner</i>, <i>Die
                            Weissen Blatter</i>, and <i>Der Zweeman</i> - will be included in the
                        Blue Mountain Project archive this summer. </p>

                        <h3>New Project Page</h3>
                    </header>
                    <p>We are happy to announce the launch of the new Blue Mountain project page: <a href="http://bluemountain.princeton.edu">http://bluemountain.princeton.edu</a>. Developed to better meet the
                        needs of researchers and to prepare for a large-scale expansion of services
                        over the next year, the new project page provides a browsable catalog of
                        Blue Mountain contents with links to full-text versions in the Blue Mountain
                        Archive. This semester, Sophie Setia (PhD candidate in English, University
                        of London) will help us compile bibliographic histories for <i>Mask</i>,
                            <i>291</i>, <i>Coeur a barbe</i>, <i>Surrealisme</i>, <i>SIC</i>,
                            <i>Poesia</i>, and <i>Veshch</i>. That rich data will be integrated into
                        the new project page and allow for even more powerful discovery of Blue
                        Mountain content.</p>

                    <p> A major development at Princeton this year was the establishment of the <a href="https://digitalhumanities.princeton.edu/">Center for Digital
                            Humanities (CDH)</a>, a hub for DH work on campus. Blue Mountain is one
                        of the sponsored CDH projects. We’re very pleased that Jean Bauer, Associate
                        Director of the CDH, has joined the Blue Mountain Steering Committee. We
                        also welcome Josh Kotin, Assistant Professor in Princeton’s Department of
                        English, to our Board of Directors. </p>

            <h2>New Blue Mountain Website</h2>
            <time pubdate="pubdate">2014-03-06</time>
        </header>
        <p>Welcome to the new and improved Blue Mountain project page. This page contains all of the
            useful information found on the earlier version, such as <a href="staff.html">who we
                are</a>, the Project's <a href="mission.html">mission and goals</a>, and which
            titles are in our collection.</p>
        <p>The most important new feature is the <a href="catalog.html">Catalog</a>, which has been
            designed to enhance the browsing experience through the addition of high-resolution
            images from our collection. Readers can now get a snapshot of the Blue Mountain
            collection, a particular title, or a single issue not only by reading bibliographic
            information, but by seeing the vivid page images of our avant-garde magazines
            side-by-side.</p>
        <p>As before, full-text searching of the collection is available at the <a href="http://bluemountain.princeton.edu/bluemtn/cgi-bin/bluemtn">Blue Mountain
                Archive</a> (a site powered by the Veridian collection-management system), which
            also allows for readers to download issues of our magazines as PDFs.</p>
        <p>Our <a href="help.html">Help</a> page gives guidance about navigating this page and about
            some of the more technical sides of Blue Mountain.</p>
