        <p>Welcome to the new and improved Blue Mountain project page. This page contains all of the
            useful information found on the earlier version, such as <a href="staff.html">who we
                are</a>, the Project's <a href="mission.html">mission and goals</a>, and which
            titles are in our collection.</p>
        <p>The most important new feature is the <a href="catalog.html">Catalog</a>, which has been
            designed to enhance the browsing experience through the addition of high-resolution
            images from our collection. Readers can now get a snapshot of the Blue Mountain
            collection, a particular title, or a single issue not only by reading bibliographic
            information, but by seeing the vivid page images of our avant-garde magazines
            side-by-side.</p>
        <p>As before, full-text searching of the collection is available at the <a href="http://bluemountain.princeton.edu/bluemtn/cgi-bin/bluemtn">Blue Mountain
                Archive</a> (a site powered by the Veridian collection-management system), which
            also allows for readers to download issues of our magazines as PDFs.</p>
        <p>Our <a href="help.html">Help</a> page gives guidance about navigating this page and about
            some of the more technical sides of Blue Mountain.</p>
        <p>Watch this News page for announcements about Blue Mountain Project activities and
            events.</p>
